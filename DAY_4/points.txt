Here we are not Creating default Public Constructer bcz if we call public then memory assigned and unused until explicitly given so we are restricting by making that as private
-> public int var {get;set;}  properties..
->by default values assigned are empty
->only in Constructer get properties can set the values
{try with set property}
->construcerts are best place to know when obj is created and assigned. thats why log history will calculate in constructers.
->Fields are private values only accessed in the class only .. By using the properties we can assign the values to Fields.
->by using sealed keyword we can make class suchthat no child class will inherit this class.

->By using virtual keyword we can allow the function to overide it in derived classes
->By using overide keyword we are overiding the function that is already present in base class with virtual keyword
